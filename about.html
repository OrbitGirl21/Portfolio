    <p>Kaitlyn Nunan is a Graphic Designer and UX Designer, with a passion for illustration. With design, she expresses herself through hierarchy and contrasts. She's been an artist all of her life, creating works of art and finding herself through creativity.
      She's married to her best friend, living in Cheney Washington, and with them they have a feline son named Lano. She spent two years studying computer science, then realized she was missing the visual creativity in her life, so she went and switched
      her major to Visual Communications Design, and learned that it was her true passion. When she isn't designing she is enjoying time spent with her husband cooking, baking, and lazing around together while they enjoy the simplicities of life, while
      occasionally being attacked by their cat.</p>
